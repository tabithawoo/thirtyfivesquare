Summer Coding","content":"**Fellow independent theatre makers at Virginia Plain are storming into the post-shutdown theatre scene with their spin on Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.**\n\n12 actors each prepare two parts, and flip a coin right at the beginning of each performance to find out who will play what.\n\nSo what does that have to do with me?\n\nMy little (big) COVID-pivot involved completing a Certificate IV in Programming (which was waaaaaaay more work than I thought it would be), and I have plans to study a Diploma in Software Development next year. So in the break, I’m trying to keep up my new skills while going back to my forever love of theatre.\n\nTo help audiences get a taste of the Twelfth Night (heads or tails) experience, I’ve made a Cast Generator complete with flipping coin.\n\n**Check it out at [twelfthnight.thirtyfivesquare.com](http://twelfthnight.thirtyfivesquare.com/).**\n\n(And if anyone’s looking for a developer intern, get in touch!)","published":"2020-12-27","cover":{"url":"https://thirtyfivesquare-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cover_cbdc65f82a.png"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Post_2","slug":"cast-generator","__params":{"slug":"cast-generator"}}}
