{"data":{"strapiPost":{"slug":"heads-or-tails","title":"Heads or tails? Summer Coding","content":"**Fellow independent theatre makers at Virginia Plain are storming into the post-shutdown theatre scene with their spin on Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.**\n\n12 actors each prepare two parts, and flip a coin right at the beginning of each performance to find out who will play what.\n \nSo what does that have to do with me?\n\nMy little (big) COVID-pivot involved completing a Certificate IV in Programming (which was waaaaaaay more work than I thought it would be), and I have plans to study a Diploma in Software Development next year. So in the break, I’m trying to keep up my new skills while going back to my forever love of theatre.\n\nTo help audiences get a taste of the Twelfth Night (heads or tails) experience, I’ve made a Cast Generator complete with flipping coin.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/tabithawoo/coinflip-generator](https://github.com/tabithawoo/coinflip-generator) (Edit: URL changed after the production closed)\n\n(And if anyone’s looking for a developer intern, get in touch!)\n","published":"2020-12-27"}},"pageContext":{"id":"Post_2","slug":"heads-or-tails","__params":{"slug":"heads-or-tails"}}}
