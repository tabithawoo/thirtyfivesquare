So in the break, I’m trying to keep up my new skills while going back to my forever love of theatre.\n\nTo help audiences get a taste of the Twelfth Night (heads or tails) experience, I’ve made a Cast Generator complete with flipping coin.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/tabithawoo/coinflip-generator](https://github.com/tabithawoo/coinflip-generator) (Edit: URL changed after the production closed)\n\n(And if anyone’s looking for a developer intern, get in touch!)\n"}]}},"pageContext":{}}
