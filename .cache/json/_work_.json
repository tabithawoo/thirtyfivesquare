Her dad wasn’t, but that’s just the end of the story. A Westerner’s Guide to the Opium Wars takes audiences as far back in Tabitha’s family tree as she knows: to the early 19th century and the First Opium War. With help from a sock puppet, Queen Victoria and a couple of Broadway showtunes, she tries to understand her cultural heritage.\n\nA Westerner’s Guide is a genre-hopping escapade of heartfelt memoir and biting historical comedy. Made by a team of second-generation Australians, it’s for anyone who has been asked “But where are you really from?” often enough to start asking themselves the same question.\n\nThis is genealogy like you’ve never seen it before.\n","presses":[{"publication":"Audrey Journal","title":"The Power of Telling Your Own Story","url":"https://www.audreyjournal.com.au/arts/the-power-of-telling-your-own-story/"},{"publication":"The West Australian","title":"Fringe World: Blue Room Theatre brings back Summer Nights program","url":"https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/fringe-festival/fringe-world-blue-room-theatre-brings-back-summer-nights-program-ng-b881050960z"},{"publication":"Urban List","title":"Here Are The Shows You Can’t Miss At Fringe World Festival 2019","url":"https://www.theurbanlist.com/perth/a-list/fringe-festival-perth"}],"reviews":[{"author":"David Zampatti ","publication":"Seesaw Magazine","snippet":"\"[Tabitha] inhabits her family’s story with charm and great loyalty, and comes out a winner.\"","source":"https://www.seesawmag.com.au/2019/02/spirited-resistance"},{"author":"Laura Money","publication":"Fourth Wall Media","snippet":"\"a wonderfully insightful show that involves the whole community.\"","source":"https://fourthwallmedia.wordpress.com/2019/02/11/fringeworld-2019-a-westerners-guide-to-the-opium-wars-4-stars/"},{"author":"Dave O'Connell","publication":"X-Press Magazine","snippet":"\"For all the historical shenanigans and the show stopping numbers that make us cringe with the underlying racism threaded into the classic lyrics, it is that personal journey that is the most heart-warming, honest, and intensely moving.

Plenty of bread at the Duckpond. Everybody is happy at the Duckpond. Nobody sleeps at the Duckpond. They only eat at the Duckpond. If you’re a good duck, you can go to the Cloud.\n\nStranded after a plane crash, a flight attendant finds herself in the absurd dystopia of the Duckpond. She befriends Duck, a duck addicted to nutrient-poor white bread, and meets the Duckpond’s all-knowing dictator, Homer. What ensues is a madcap scroll through funny animal videos, clickbait listicles, and bread-related humour.\n\nSwitch off your smartphones for this brand new play about clickbait and the attention economy.
